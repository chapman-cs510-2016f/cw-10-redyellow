    "Generally, there are two ways to define the array (pass by value and pass by reference) and one way to define the const char foo (pass by reference, or pointer) but later it uses two ways to print it out.  Specifically,\n",

    "1. Define an array of size 10 in memory;\n",
    "2. Later use a *for* loop to assign values to this array, where the ith value in the array just equals i;\n",
    "3. Use memblock and the function malloc to define the same array;\n",
    "4. Allocate memory for the array using the function malloc, and if there is no enough space in memory, return an error and print out an error message \"malloc failed\";\n",
    "5. Otherwise, in the same *for* loop above, assign values to the array that the ith value in the array equals i.  It uses function *(memblock+i)=i because *(memblock) refers to the value of the first element in the array;\n",
    "6. Define a constant character string foo;\n",
    "7. Print out the values in array, values in the allocated memory, values in foo, with increment three bytes beyond the allocated memory (buffer overrun). \"\\t\" means tab so for each i value, all the four outputs can appear in one line;\n",
